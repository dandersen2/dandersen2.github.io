    How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
      This process was fairly simple but it made it easier and less complicated to be able to talk it through with someone else. I also ended up doing this process with two different people which further helped me to learn it as well as help my partner on the second run-through.

    Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
      Wireframing does seem to be helpful to the process although maybe not so much just yet because we haven't actually applied most of the layout or structure of the page yet.

    What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
      A good wireframe would include all of the elements that you have decided tha page should contain while not being overcluttered or busy. It should also be aesthetically pleasing by having a natural flow to, centering text, and using the right size ratios for each element or text block.

    What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
      In this section I learned about using footers which seems to be very prevalent on most pages so I imagine I will be using it a lot.
