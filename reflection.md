####What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
  If you are to consider the content of an element being surrounded by a box, the borders are the edges of that box, the margins are space that is placed as a buffer outside that box, and padding is a buffer that is placed within that box between the border and the content.

####What did you learn about CSS positioning?
  CSS positioning is extremely important to make your site appear correctly when opened in the browser. It is important to consider the positioning before you begin arranging your html and adding too much CSS. I learned this when I tried to add my footer, which seemed to require much more work to get placed at the bottom of the page than I had expected. I needed to use a wrapper class and implement some css trickery to do so but it is not completely functional just yet. Absolute, relative, static, and fixed are the different properties for this attribute and have a large influence on where things appear on the page.

####What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
  The easiest part seemd to be the actual content within the "main" tags of my html. Everything just seemed to work pretty easily and on the first, second, or third try. The header was a little more difficult, taking about ten tries, and the footer has taken approximately 100 tries and counting...(Insert angry emoji here). I feel as though I'm very close though.

####What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
  I learned the importance of thinking about the wireframe and the overall structure of the page from the beginning. This helped me to visualize the parent-child relationships between the different elements on my page. Using good indenting practices in my html seemed to help a lot. The Chrom devtools were also very helpful for cutting out some of the trial and error time associated with opening the file, making changes, saving, and opening in the browser again. They allow youto see the changes in real-time which is a very helpful tool both in learning and in practice.
